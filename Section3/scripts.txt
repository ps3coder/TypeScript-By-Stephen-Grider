• Intro to type annotations and type interface

- These are two different systems in TS but are discussed together for clarity
- They apply differently to variables , functions and objects
- We'll cover type annotations and interface for variables first then functions and objects

• Type annotations
- A small piece of code written to tell TS what type a variable refers to

• Type interface
- TS automatically determines what type a variable rerfers to 

• Comparison of Type annotations and Type interface

- Both relate to the type of value a variable refers to
- In type annotations the developer mannually specify the type
- In type interface TS automatically determines the type
- They are somewhat opposed manual specification vs automatic type deduction

• Key focus of the discussion

- The main question should we manually specify type or leave it to TS
- understanding why these features are important and when to use them

• the rule of thumb here is if we're doing the initialization and declaration on the same
• Type inference allows TS to determine variable types without explicit annotations.
• Variable declaration and initialization happen in two steps
1. declaration(left of the equal sign)
2. Initialization(right of the equal sign)
•Type inference occurs when declaration and initialization are on the same line allowing TS to infer the type of the variable.
• If initialization happens separately , Ts assign the type any and type inference does not occur.
• TS uses type inference by default when declaration and initilization occur together.
• Type annotations should be manually added in specific cases.
• Three scenarios required type annotations
• in most cases rely on type inference to reduce the need for manual annotation.


• we know that type inference in TS often inferes type automatically throughout the application.
• Manual Type annotations : There are certain cases where we need to manually add type annotations to help TS along.
• Three scenarios for type annotations: We'll focus on these scenarios where manual types annotations are neccessary


Case1 : Functions returningn any TYpe : refer variables.ts for more details

• Problems with any type:
-json.parse return any because TS cant predict what it will return 
- we should add a type annotations for variables returned by json.parse

• TYpe annotations for objects:
 : add types annotations for each element 


• Solutions:
- Use boolean | nummber via a pipe to allow multiple types
